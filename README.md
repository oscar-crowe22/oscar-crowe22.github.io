### Photo Editor
- <strong>Tools Used:</strong> Java was used to develop the entire application, GIT CI/CD > Pipelines in yaml, JUnit Testing.
- The largest project I've worked on is this non destructive photo editor. The project was group based and foccused heavily on CI/CD pipelines and git integration. We had automated tests running to make sure the program was fucntioning correctly. Using java I developed image proccessing classes, different filters, drawing tools and kernel opperations. Overall the entire project contained approximatley 35 files which helped me develop skills to manage larger tasks.
